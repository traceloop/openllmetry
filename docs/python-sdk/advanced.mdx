## Grouping multiple workflows

Sometimes, you'll use the same workflow multiple times and you want to track the behavior of all the workflow runs together.
For example, when you run a workflow, get some user feedback, and then run it again based on the feedback.
In this case, you can set a `correlation_id` to group all the workflow runs together.
This will usually be a `user_id` or `session_id`.

Set the correlation ID anywhere in the app by calling:

```python
Tracer.set_correlation_id("user12345")
```

All further workflow runs will be grouped together under this correlation ID.
