title: "Exporting your Traces"
description: "Connect to any observability platform - Traceloop, Datadog, Honeycomb, and others"
---

Since Traceloop SDK is using OpenTelemetry under the hood, you can see everything
in any observability platform that supports OpenTelemetry.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Traceloop">
  Go to [Traceloop Environments Management](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys)
  (you can also reach here by clicking on the cog icon on the upper right corner of the dashboard and select **Environments**).
  Click on **Generate API Key**. Click **Copy Key** to copy the API key as it won't be shown again.

Set the API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.
For on-prem deployments, set `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` to the URL of your Traceloop instance.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Datadog">
With datadog, there are 2 options - you can either export directly to a Datadog Agent in your cluster, or through an OpenTelemetry Collector (which requires that you deploy one in your cluster).

See also [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/).

Exporting directly to an agent is easiest.
To do that, first enable the OTLP GRPC collector in your agent configuration.
This depends on how you deployed your Datadog agent. For example, if you've used a Helm chart,
you can add the following to your `values.yaml`
(see [this](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=kuberneteshelmvaluesyaml#enabling-otlp-ingestion-on-the-datadog-agent) for other options):

```yaml
otlp:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        enabled: true
```

Then, set this env var, and you're done!

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<datadog-agent-hostname>:4317
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="New Relic">
Since New Relic natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to New Relic's endpoint and set the API key:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://otlp.nr-data.net:443
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="api-key=<YOUR_NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY>"
```

For more information check out the [docs link](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app/#review-settings).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Honeycomb">
Since Honeycomb natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to Honeycomb's endpoint and set the
API key:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://api.honeycomb.io
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SignNoz">
### With SigNoz cloud

Since SigNoz natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to SigNoz's endpoint and set the
ingestion key:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
```

Where `region` depends on the choice of your SigNoz cloud region:
| Region | Endpoint |
| ------ | -------- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

Validate your configuration by [following these instructions](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python/#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces)

### With Self-Hosted version

Once you have an up and running instance of SigNoz, use the following environment variables to export your traces:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4317"
```
