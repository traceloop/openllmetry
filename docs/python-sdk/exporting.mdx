title: "Exporting your Traces"
description: "Connect to any observability platform - Traceloop, Dynatrace, Datadog, Honeycomb, and others"
---

Since Traceloop SDK is using OpenTelemetry under the hood, you can see everything
in any observability platform that supports OpenTelemetry.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Traceloop">
  Go to [Traceloop Environments Management](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys)
  (you can also reach here by clicking on the cog icon on the upper right corner of the dashboard and select **Environments**).
  Click on **Generate API Key**. Click **Copy Key** to copy the API key as it won't be shown again.

Set the API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.
For on-prem deployments, set `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` to the URL of your Traceloop instance.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dynatrace">
Analyze all collected LLM traces within Dynatrace by using the native OpenTelemetry ingest endpoint of your Dynatrace environment.
  
Go to your Dynatrace environment and create a new access token under **Manage Access Tokens**.  
The access token needs the following permission scopes that allow the ingest of OpenTelemetry spans, metrics and logs 
(openTelemetryTrace.ingest, metrics.ingest, logs.ingest).

Set `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` environment variable to the URL of your Dynatrace OpenTelemetry ingest endpoint

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https:\<YOUR_ENV>.live.dynatrace.com\api\v2\otlp`
```

Set the `TRACELOOP_HEADERS` environment variable to include your previously created access token

```bash
TRACELOOP_HEADERS=Authorization=Api-Token%20<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`
```

Done! All the exported spans along with their span attributes will show up within the Dynatrace trace view.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Datadog">
With datadog, there are 2 options - you can either export directly to a Datadog Agent in your cluster, or through an OpenTelemetry Collector (which requires that you deploy one in your cluster).

See also [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/).

Exporting directly to an agent is easiest.
To do that, first enable the OTLP HTTP collector in your agent configuration.
This depends on how you deployed your Datadog agent. For example, if you've used a Helm chart,
you can add the following to your `values.yaml`
(see [this](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=kuberneteshelmvaluesyaml#enabling-otlp-ingestion-on-the-datadog-agent) for other options):

```yaml
otlp:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      http:
        enabled: true
```

Then, set this env var, and you're done!

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<datadog-agent-hostname>:4318
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="New Relic">
Since New Relic natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to New Relic's endpoint and set the API key:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://otlp.nr-data.net:443
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="api-key=<YOUR_NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY>"
```

For more information check out the [docs link](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app/#review-settings).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Honeycomb">
Since Honeycomb natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to Honeycomb's endpoint and set the
API key:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://api.honeycomb.io
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Grafana Tempo">
First, go to the Grafana Cloud account page under `https://grafana.com/orgs/<your org name>`,
and click on **Send Traces** under Tempo. In **Grafana Data Source settings**,
note the `URL` and the `User` values. Click **Generate now** to generate an API key and copy it.

### With Grafana Agent

Make sure you have an agent installed and running in your cluster.
The host to target your traces is constructed is the hostname of the `URL` noted above, without the `https://` and the trailing `/tempo`.

Add this to the configuration of your agent:

```yaml
traces:
  configs:
    - name: default
      remote_write:
        - endpoint: <Grafana Hostname>:443
          basic_auth:
            username: <User from Grafana Cloud>
            password: <Grafana Cloud API Token>
      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:
```

<Warning>
  Note the endpoint. The URL you need to use is without `https` and the trailing
  `/`. So `https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net/tempo` should be used as
  `tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443`.
</Warning>

Set this as an environment variable in your app:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<grafana-agent-hostname>:4318
```

### Without Grafana Agent

Grafana cloud currently only supports sending traces to some of its regions.
Before you begin, [check out this list](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/otlp/send-data-otlp/)
and make sure your region is supported.

In a terminal, type:

```bash
echo -n "<your user id>:<your api key>" | base64
```

Note the result which is a base64 encoding of your user id and api key.

The URL you'll use as the destination for the traces depends on your region/zone. For example, for AWS US Central this will be `prod-us-central-0`.
See [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/otlp/send-data-otlp/#before-you-begin) for the names of the zones you should use below.

Then, you can set the following environment variables when running your app with Traceloop SDK installed:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://otlp-gateway-<zone>.grafana.net/otlp
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic%20<base64 encoded user id and api key>"
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="OpenTelemetry Collector">
Since Traceloop is emitting standard OTLP HTTP (standard OpenTelemetry protocol), you can use any OpenTelemetry Collector, which gives you the flexibility
to then connect to any backend you want.
First, [deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#create-an-opentelemetry-collector-optional)
in your cluster.
Then, point the output of the Traceloop SDK to the collector by setting:
```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://<opentelemetry-collector-hostname>:4318
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SigNoz">
### With SigNoz cloud

Since SigNoz natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to SigNoz's endpoint and set the
ingestion key (note no `https` in the URL):

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
```

Where `region` depends on the choice of your SigNoz cloud region:
| Region | Endpoint |
| ------ | -------- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

Validate your configuration by [following these instructions](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python/#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces)

### With Self-Hosted version

Once you have an up and running instance of SigNoz, use the following environment variables to export your traces:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4318"
```
