You can contribute both new instrumentations or update and improve the Python SDK wrapper.

We use `poetry` to manage packages, and each package is managed independently under its own directory under `/packages`.
All instrumentations depends on `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions-ai`,
and `traceloop-sdk` depends on all the instrumentations.

If adding a new instrumentation, make sure to use it in `traceloop-sdk`, and write proper tests.

[Join our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/traceloopcommunity/shared_invite/zt-1plpfpm6r-zOHKI028VkpcWdobX65C~g) to chat and get help on any issues you may encounter.

## Debugging

No matter if you're working on an instrumentation or on the SDK, we recommend testing the changes by using
the SDK in the sample app (`/packages/sample-app`) or the tests under the SDK.

## Running tests

All tests are currently under `packages/python-sdk`. Since we wanted to simulate a real environment,
the tests make actual calls to OpenAI and other services.
To run them, you'll need to set up the following env vars:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=...
```

Run the tests using:

```bash
cd packages/python-sdk
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```
