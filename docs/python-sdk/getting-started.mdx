Install Traceloop by following these 2 easy steps and get instant monitoring.

## Install the SDK

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Poetry">
  
  Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
poetry add traceloop-sdk
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pip">
    Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install traceloop-sdk
```

You should also add Traceloop to your `requirements.txt` file as `traceloop-sdk`.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure the Instrumentation in your app

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```python
Traceloop.init(app_name="your_app_name")
```

You'll need to [start a new span](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/trace.html)
for each operation you want to trace. We have a set of [decorators](/python-sdk/decorators) to make this easier.

Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_API_ENDPOINT`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/python-sdk/exporting).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

Set Traceloop's API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.
For on-prem deployments, set `TRACELOOP_API_ENDPOINT` to the URL of your Traceloop instance.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.

## Next Steps

You can annotate specific workflows, chains, and agents to get better visibility into complex processes in your app.
See [Decorators](/python-sdk/decorators) for more information.
