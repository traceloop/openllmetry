## Configure the Instrumentation in your app

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com), click on the organization icon at the top right corner and select `API Keys`.
Generate a new API key and copy it over. It won't be shown again.

Set the API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.
For on-prem deployments, set `TRACELOOP_API_ENDPOINT` to the URL of your Traceloop instance.

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```python
Tracer.init(app_name="your_app_name")
```

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in your Traceloop dashboard.

Next, you can annotate specific workflows, chains, and agents to get better visibility into complex processes in your app.
See [Decorators](/python-sdk/decorators) for more information.
