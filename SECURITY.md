At Traceloop, we take the security of our systems very seriously. We know that despite our best efforts to make our systems secure, there is always some level of vulnerability involved.

If you happen to find any kind of vulnerability, please inform us so we can get it addressed as soon as possible. We'd like to request your assistance to improve the security posture of our clients and systems.

## Out of scope vulnerabilities:

- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.

- Unauthenticated/logout/login CSRF.

- Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.

- Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).

- Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS.

- Email spoofing

- Missing DNSSEC, CAA, CSP headers

- Lack of Secure or HTTP only flag on non-sensitive cookies

- We do not permit automated scanners on our infrastructure or dashboard. If you wish to do so please contact us and we can get set up with an instance of our sandbox environment for you.
 
- Do not exploit the vulnerability or bug you have found-for example, do not download more data than you need to prove a vulnerability, delete or modify other peoples data

- Don't reveal the problem until it is resolved,
- Do not use physical security attacks, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam, or third party applications.

- Provide as much information as possible to let us reproduce the problem so we can solve it as fast as possible. Usually, giving the IP address or URL of the affected system, along with a description of the vulnerability, is enough, but sometimes you need to explain a little bit more.

## What do we promise:
