"""
Auto-generated test based on recorded span patterns.
Generated from actual mocked workflow execution with 6 recorded spans.

Key findings from recording:
- Agent spans (*.agent): âœ… Have gen_ai.agent.name
- Response spans (openai.response): âœ… Have gen_ai.agent.name
- Workflow spans (Agent Workflow): âœ… Correctly do NOT have gen_ai.agent.name
- Tool spans: Not captured in this recording (API auth prevented execution)
