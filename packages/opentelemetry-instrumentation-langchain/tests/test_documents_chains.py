    Today, all ridges and faces of the Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons,
    and mountain guides take a large number of people up the northeast Hörnli route
    each summer. In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during
    summer. By modern standards, the climb is fairly difficult (AD Difficulty rating),
    but not hard for skilled mountaineers according to French climbing grades. There
    are fixed ropes on parts of the route to help. Still, it should be remembered that
    several climbers may die on the mountain each year.
    The usual pattern of ascent is to take the Schwarzsee cable car up from Zermatt,
    hike up to the Hörnli Hut elev. 3,260 m (10,700 ft), a large stone building at the
    base of the main ridge, and spend the night. The next day, climbers rise at 3:30 am
    so as to reach the summit and descend before the regular afternoon clouds and storms
    come in. The Solvay Hut located on the ridge at 4,003 m (13,133 ft) can be used only
    in a case of emergency.
    Other popular routes on the mountain include the Italian (Lion) ridge (AD+ Difficulty
    rating) and the Zmutt ridge (D Difficulty rating). The four faces, as well as the
    Furggen ridge, constitute the most challenging routes to the summit. The north face
    is amongst the six most difficult faces of the Alps, as well as ‘The Trilogy’, the
    three hardest of the six, along with the north faces of the Eiger and the Grandes
    Jorasses (TD+ Difficulty rating).
