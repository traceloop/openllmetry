      a concise summary of the following:\\n\\n\\n\\\"Today, all ridges and faces
      of the Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons,\\n    and mountain guides
      take a large number of people up the northeast H\xF6rnli route\\n    each summer.
      In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during\\n    summer.
      By modern standards, the climb is fairly difficult (AD Difficulty rating),\\n
      \   but not hard for skilled mountaineers according to French climbing grades.
      There\\n    are fixed ropes on parts of the route to help. Still, it should
      be remembered that\\n    several climbers may die on the mountain each year.\\n
      \   The usual pattern of ascent is to take the Schwarzsee cable car up from
      Zermatt,\\n    hike up to the H\xF6rnli Hut elev. 3,260 m (10,700 ft), a large
      stone building at the\\n    base of the main ridge, and spend the night. The
      next day, climbers rise at 3:30 am\\n    so as to reach the summit and descend
      before the regular afternoon clouds and storms\\n    come in. The Solvay Hut
      located on the ridge at 4,003 m (13,133 ft) can be used only\\n    in a case
      of emergency.\\n    Other popular routes on the mountain include the Italian
      (Lion) ridge (AD+ Difficulty\\n    rating) and the Zmutt ridge (D Difficulty
      rating). The four faces, as well as the\\n    Furggen ridge, constitute the
      most challenging routes to the summit. The north face\\n    is amongst the six
      most difficult faces of the Alps, as well as \u2018The Trilogy\u2019, the\\n
      \   three hardest of the six, along with the north faces of the Eiger and the
      Grandes\\n    Jorasses (TD+ Difficulty rating).\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"}],\"temperature\":0.75,\"stream\":false}"
