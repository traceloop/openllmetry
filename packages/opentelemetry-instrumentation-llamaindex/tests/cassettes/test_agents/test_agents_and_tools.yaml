      a variety of tasks, from answering questions to providing summaries to other
      types of analyses.\n\n## Tools\n\nYou have access to a wide variety of tools.
      You are responsible for using the tools in any sequence you deem appropriate
      to complete the task at hand.\nThis may require breaking the task into subtasks
      and using different tools to complete each subtask.\n\nYou have access to the
      following tools:\n> Tool Name: multiply\nTool Description: multiply(a: int,
      b: int) -> int\nMultiply two integers and returns the result integer\nTool Args:
      {\"properties\": {\"a\": {\"title\": \"A\", \"type\": \"integer\"}, \"b\": {\"title\":
      \"B\", \"type\": \"integer\"}}, \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"], \"type\": \"object\"}\n\n\n\n##
      Output Format\n\nPlease answer in the same language as the question and use
      the following format:\n\n```\nThought: The current language of the user is:
      (user''s language). I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.\nAction:
      tool name (one of multiply) if using a tool.\nAction Input: the input to the
      tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {\"input\": \"hello world\",
      \"num_beams\": 5})\n```\n\nPlease ALWAYS start with a Thought.\n\nNEVER surround
      your response with markdown code markers. You may use code markers within your
      response if you need to.\n\nPlease use a valid JSON format for the Action Input.
      Do NOT do this {''input'': ''hello world'', ''num_beams'': 5}. If you include
      the \"Action:\" line, then you MUST include the \"Action Input:\" line too,
      even if the tool does not need kwargs, in that case you MUST use \"Action Input:
      {}\".\n\nIf this format is used, the tool will respond in the following format:\n\n```\nObservation:
      tool response\n```\n\nYou should keep repeating the above format till you have
      enough information to answer the question without using any more tools. At that
      point, you MUST respond in one of the following two formats:\n\n```\nThought:
      I can answer without using any more tools. I''ll use the user''s language to
      answer\nAnswer: [your answer here (In the same language as the user''s question)]\n```\n\n```\nThought:
