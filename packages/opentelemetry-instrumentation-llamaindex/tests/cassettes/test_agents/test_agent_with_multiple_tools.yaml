      include the \"Action Input:\" line too, even if the tool does not need kwargs,
      in that case you MUST use \"Action Input: {}\".\n\nIf this format is used, the
      tool will respond in the following format:\n\n```\nObservation: tool response\n```\n\nYou
      should keep repeating the above format till you have enough information to answer
      the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond in
      one of the following two formats:\n\n```\nThought: I can answer without using
      any more tools. I''ll use the user''s language to answer\nAnswer: [your answer
