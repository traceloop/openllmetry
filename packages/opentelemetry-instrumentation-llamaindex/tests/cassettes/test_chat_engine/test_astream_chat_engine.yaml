      I Worked On  February 2021  Before college the two main things I worked on,
      outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn''t write essays. I wrote
      what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are:
      short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters
      with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.  The first programs I
      tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was
      then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The
      school district''s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school,
      and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini
      Bond villain''s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014
      CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under
      bright fluorescent lights.  The language we used was an early version of Fortran.
      You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader
      and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would
      ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.  I was puzzled
      by the 1401. I couldn''t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there''s
      not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data
      stored on punched cards, and I didn''t have any data stored on punched cards.
      The only other option was to do things that didn''t rely on any input, like
      calculate approximations of pi, but I didn''t know enough math to do anything
      interesting of that type. So I''m not surprised I can''t remember any programs
      I wrote, because they can''t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment
      I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn''t.
      On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical
      error, as the data center manager''s expression made clear.  With microcomputers,
      everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of
      you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead
      of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]  The
      first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as
      a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching
      him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.  Computers
      were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced
      my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the
      Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming.
      I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly,
      and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was
      only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he''d write 2 pages at a time
      and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.  Though
      I liked programming, I didn''t plan to study it in college. In college I was
      going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my
      naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to
      which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What
      I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much
      of the space of ideas that there wasn''t much left for these supposed ultimate
      truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other
      fields felt could safely be ignored.  I couldn''t have put this into words when
      I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and
      they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.  AI was in the air in
      the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work
      on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured
      an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry
      Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven''t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,
      so I don''t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely
      into its world.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  All

      SHRDLU. I haven''t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don''t
      know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its
      world. It seemed only a matter of time before we''d have Mike, and when I saw
      Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most.
      All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.  There weren''t any classes in
      AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach
      myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as
      the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty
      primitive, and programmers'' ideas correspondingly so. The default language
      at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar
      elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was
      years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was
      more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn''t happening
      in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years
      I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.  For my undergraduate thesis,
      I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was
      a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief \u2014
      hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 \u2014 that it was already climbing
      the lower slopes of intelligence.  I had gotten into a program at Cornell that
      didn''t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked,
      and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial
      Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find
      that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At
      the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons
      I was about to discover.  I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were
      renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I''d visited because Rich Draves
      went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who''d invented the type of parser
      I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.  I
      don''t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment,
      but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at
      the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that''s
      told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation
      and adds it to the list of things it knows.  What these programs really showed
      was that there''s a subset of natural language that''s a formal language. But
      a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between
      what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,
      in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing
      AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work.
      Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to
      write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was
      never going to get us Mike.  So I looked around to see what I could salvage
      from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that
      Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with
      AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.
      So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp
      hacking. It''s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started
      writing that book. But there''s nothing like writing a book about something

      hacking. It''s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started
      writing that book. But there''s nothing like writing a book about something
      to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn''t published till 1993, but I
      wrote much of it in grad school.  Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between
      two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems
      people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory
      \u2014 indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two
      halves \u2014 but building things seemed so much more exciting.  The problem
      with systems work, though, was that it didn''t last. Any program you wrote today,
      no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might
      mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed,
      it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the
      field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.  There were some
      surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone
      who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but
      they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted
      one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.  I wanted
      not just to build things, but to build things that would last.  In this dissatisfied
      state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school.
      One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I''d spent a lot of time
      as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might
      seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something
      you could make that would last. Paintings didn''t become obsolete. Some of the
      best ones were hundreds of years old.  And moreover this was something you could
      make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course,
      but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had
      to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly
      independent. You wouldn''t have a boss, or even need to get research funding.  I
      had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I''d
      never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made
      art \u2014 that it didn''t just appear spontaneously \u2014 but it was as if
      the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago
      or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.
      The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun,
      seemed almost miraculous.  That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard.
      Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,
      was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking,
      he never said anything.  So now I was in a PhD program in computer science,
      yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and
      working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working
      energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.  I didn''t see a
      way out of this situation. I didn''t want to drop out of grad school, but how
      else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked
      out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he''d
      found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.  Then one day in April
      1990 a crack appeared in the wall.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  Grad

      1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked
      if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn''t have a word of my
      dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking
      in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that
      remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I
      was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I''ll give
      you something to read in a few days.\"  I picked applications of continuations
      as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded
      languages. There''s a whole world there that''s barely been explored. But all
      I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation
      sufficed, just barely.  Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to
      two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because
      it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and
      I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.  I''d applied
      for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college
      again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art
      schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer
      sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means
      the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing,
      color, and design.  Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter
      from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they''d sent it to Cambridge
      England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance
      exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let
      me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work
      I''d done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived
      cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.  Only stranieri (foreigners)
      had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a way of
      excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of
      studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been
      outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation
      that summer, but I still don''t know how I managed to pass the written exam.
      I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and
      that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most
      of my limited vocabulary. [2]  I''m only up to age 25 and already there are
      such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august
      institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet
      again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department
      at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long
      since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn''t require the faculty
      to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn''t require the students
      to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly
      to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little
      stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and
      a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except
      hardly anyone else painted her besides me.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  [2]  I''m

      to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted
      her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally
      trying to imitate things they''d seen in American art magazines.  Our model
      turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination
      of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She''d copy an obscure
      old painting out of a book, and then he''d take the copy and maltreat it to
      make it look old. [3]  While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting
      still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room
      was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all
      I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting
      people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can''t move. People can''t
      sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don''t sit
      very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint
      a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you''re
      painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from
      what you''re seeing. You don''t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely
      photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it''s
      been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for
      example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that
      it''s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make
      paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical
      sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]  I liked painting
      still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life,
      we aren''t consciously aware of much we''re seeing. Most visual perception is
      handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that''s a water
      droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points
      are, or \"that''s a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every
      leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting
      to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you
      have to look more closely, and when you do there''s a lot to see. You can still
      be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually
      take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about
      something people usually take for granted.  This is not the only way to paint.
      I''m not 100% sure it''s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough
      bet to be worth trying.  Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could
      see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of
      passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn''t teaching me anything except
      Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went
      back to the US.  I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was
      very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD
      the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software
      for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how
      I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf
      still had a few years to live yet. [5]  Interleaf had done something pretty
      bold. Inspired by Emacs, they''d added a scripting language, and even made the
      scripting language a dialect of Lisp.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  But

      Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest
      thing I''ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers,
      because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C
      cake, and since I didn''t know C and didn''t want to learn it, I never understood
      most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when
      a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That
      seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around
      to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the
      end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp,
      which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.  The good part was that
      I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence,
      after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7
      a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I
      was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save
      enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.  I learned some
      useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I
      learned that it''s better for technology companies to be run by product people
      than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it
      are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many
      people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it''s depressing, that planned
      meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers
      are a dangerous source of money, and that there''s not much overlap between
      conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional
      offices and the optimal place for it.  But the most important thing I learned,
      and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the
      high end: that it''s good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that
      will be less prestigious, because if you''re not, someone else will be, and
      will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a
      danger sign.  When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do
      freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how
      I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project
      later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described
      it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard
      at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part
      of my life.  In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.

      lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear

      not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor
      belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture

      the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation
      had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke.

      was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which
      to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature
      style.  A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business
      is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as
      yours and no one else''s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like
      a certain kind of cartoon, you know it''s by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see
      a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager,
      you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That''s not always why artists
      have a signature style, but it''s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.
      [6]  There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high
      school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the
      country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized
      by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they
      did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I
      was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.  I
      learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically
      teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped
      out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet
      did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned
      in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn''t much more than my
      current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes,
      I wanted it! [7]  Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman
      Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something
      similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there''s
      a tiny corner that''s not rich, or at least wasn''t in 1993. It''s called Yorkville,
      and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist \u2014 in the strictly
      technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.  I was nervous about
      money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp
      hacking work was very rare, and I didn''t want to have to program in another
      language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my
      unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on
      Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a
      textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all
      my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp,
      is one that I painted around this time.)  The best thing about New York for
      me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter,
      one of the early photorealists, and I''d taken her painting class at Harvard.
      I''ve never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former
      students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became
      her de facto studio assistant.  She liked to paint on big, square canvases,
      4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these
      monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn''t
      that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to
      me: why don''t I become rich? Then I''ll be able to work on whatever I want.  Meanwhile
      I''d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web.",

      on whatever I want.  Meanwhile I''d been hearing more and more about this new
      thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited
      him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me
      that the web would be a big deal. I''d seen what graphical user interfaces had
      done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the
      same for the internet.  If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving
      the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided
      we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can''t honestly say,
      after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup
      idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn''t want to be online, and
      still don''t, not the fancy ones. That''s not how they sell. I wrote some software
      to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images
      and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries.
      To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to
      give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid
      us.  Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for
      the order buttons they were identical to the sites we''d been generating for
      galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\"
      was something we already knew how to build.  So in the summer of 1995, after
      I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we
      started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going
      to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That
      was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software
      or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we''d at least
      try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart,
      and I wrote a new site generator for stores \u2014 in Lisp, of course.  We were
      working out of Robert''s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big
      chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there
      was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was
      lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What
      if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on
      links? Then we''d never have to write anything to run on users'' computers.
      We could generate the sites on the same server we''d serve them from. Users
      wouldn''t need anything more than a browser.  This kind of software, known as
      a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn''t clear that it was even
      possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder
      that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12,
      we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a
      whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything
      into the command line on the server.  Now we felt like we were really onto something.
      I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn''t
      need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a
      whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as
      the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software
      right on the server.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  Users

      the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software
      right on the server.  We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact
      that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from
      Idelle''s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work
      and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later
      this deal became the model for Y Combinator''s. We knew founders needed something
      like this, because we''d needed it ourselves.  At this stage I had a negative
      net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than
      counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set
      aside the proper proportion of the money I''d made consulting for Interleaf?
      No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed
      that seed funding to live on.  We originally hoped to launch in September, but
      we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed
      to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages,
      they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except
      that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures
      stored in a hash table on the server.  It helped to have studied art, because
      the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the
      key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and
      fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom
      look more legit than a big company.  (If you''re curious why my site looks so
      old-fashioned, it''s because it''s still made with this software. It may look
      clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)  In September, Robert
      rebelled. \"We''ve been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it''s
      still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working
      on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more
      programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really
      good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because
      at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his
      life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was
      right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.  It
      was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They''re the two most independent-minded
      people I know, and in completely different ways. If you could see inside Rtm''s
      brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see
      inside Trevor''s it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.  We
      opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we
      waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually
      almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce,
      but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]  There were three main
      parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which
      I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept
      track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor
      was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and
      didn''t have to integrate with any other software except Robert''s and Trevor''s,

      the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had
      to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next
      3 years were instead the most stressful.  There were a lot of startups making
      ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the
      Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive.
      It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb
      even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small
      store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and
      a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn''t because of some
      clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid
      for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.  We did a lot of
      things right by accident like that. For example, we did what''s now called \"doing
      things that don''t scale,\" although at the time we would have described it
      as \"being so lame that we''re driven to the most desperate measures to get
      users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed
      particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d''etre of our software was
      that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.  We
      learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if
      you could only have a small image of a man''s shirt (and all images were small
      then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than
      a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it
      meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men''s shirts. My first set of scans
      were so beautiful too.  Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing
      to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how
      it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by
      \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of
      it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way
      I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was
      all theirs. Maybe one day we''d have so many users that I couldn''t scan their
      images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.  Another
      thing I didn''t get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of
      a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996
      and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered
      was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the
      sense that that''s how much money you''re making, and if you''re not making
      enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes
      care of the absolute number. If we''d been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator,
      I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you''re doing fine. You''re
      growing 7x a year. Just don''t hire too many more people and you''ll soon be
      profitable, and then you''ll control your own destiny.  Alas I hired lots more
      people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that''s
      what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful
      of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn''t reach breakeven until

      the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for
      the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs
      at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.  It was a huge
      relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It
      was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn''t
      feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all
      too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months.
      Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started.
      So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were
      going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking
      that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.  The
      next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the
      least productive of my life. I didn''t realize it at the time, but I was worn
      out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to
      California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning,
      but fatigue combined with Yahoo''s prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm
      in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly
      like working at Interleaf.  Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought
      us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they''d never be worth
      anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung
      on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left.
      It had been so long since I''d painted anything that I''d half forgotten why
      I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men''s shirts
      for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself,
      and now I was rich, so I should go paint.  When I said I was leaving, my boss
      at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about
      the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took
      such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.
      My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving
      that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup,
      and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet
      Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire.
      Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and
      yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.  But I really was quitting to paint, and
      I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I''d already burned 4 years
      getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their
      companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That''s what I should
      have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but
      the idea never occurred to me.  So I tried to paint, but I just didn''t seem
      to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn''t know
      many people in California. I''d compounded this problem by buying a house up
      in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere.",

      I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you''ll
      be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old
      life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to
      paint there, even though I didn''t know any of them.  When I got back to New
      York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds.
      I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn''t
      been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and
      (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past
      charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for
      a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still
      life where I''d paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print
      it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second
      still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn''t rotted yet).  Meanwhile
      I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood
      to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge
      of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized
      there wasn''t one. Huh.  Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea.
      It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future.
      Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on
      our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for
      them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications
      could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating
      images, taking credit card payments, etc.  I got so excited about this idea
      that I couldn''t think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was
      the future. I didn''t particularly want to start another company, but it was
      clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move
      to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me,
      but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he''d
      made a lot of money the last time I''d lured him into working on one of my schemes,
      it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a
      plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.  Hmph. Well, I''d do it myself
      then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads
      who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it''s now clear
      is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software.
      The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.
      But I wasn''t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general
      audience; we''d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.  By then there was a name
      for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or
      ASP. This name didn''t last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\"
      but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it
      was going to be called Aspra.  I started working on the application builder,
      Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first
      two services (images and phone calls).", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  I

      on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services
      (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I
      really didn''t want to run a company \u2014 especially not a big one, which
      it was looking like this would have to be. I''d only started Viaweb because
      I needed the money. Now that I didn''t need money anymore, why was I doing this?
      If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. I''d
      build a subset that could be done as an open source project.  Much to my surprise,
      the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started
      Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new
      architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about
      it and even trying to write some of it.  The subset I would build as an open
      source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn''t even have
      to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because
      one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and
      partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all
      existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer
      Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc,
      in a house I bought in Cambridge.  The following spring, lightning struck. I
      was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we''d
      used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,
      on paulgraham.com, which I''d created years before using Viaweb but had never
      used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened?
      The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]  Wow,
      I thought, there''s an audience. If I write something and put it on the web,
      anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In
      the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters
      known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was
      to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could
      publish anything.  This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many
      people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the
      infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it
      had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand
      the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays.
      [11]  In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly
      small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties
      in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing
      about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written,
      because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was
      going to write them. [12]  I''ve worked on several different things, but to
      the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it
      was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever
      else I did, I''d always write essays too.  I knew that online essays would be
      a marginal medium at first. Socially they''d seem more like rants posted by
      nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions
      published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging
      instead of discouraging.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  Except

      instead of discouraging.  One of the most conspicuous patterns I''ve noticed
      in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that
      weren''t prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form
      of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them.
      I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I''m writing, and
      I explain that it''s an essay I''m going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp,
      though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems
      about as hip.  It''s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But
      when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of
      prestige, it''s a sign both that there''s something real to be discovered there,
      and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger
      for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire
      to impress people. So while working on things that aren''t prestigious doesn''t
      guarantee you''re on the right track, it at least guarantees you''re not on
      the most common type of wrong one.  Over the next several years I wrote lots
      of essays about all kinds of different topics. O''Reilly reprinted a collection
      of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it.
      I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners
      for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for
      groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and
      later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.  One night in October 2003
      there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels,
      who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their
      friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would
      be people they didn''t know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone
      I didn''t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston.
      A couple days later I asked her out.  Jessica was in charge of marketing at
      a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over
      the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised
      how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided
      to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.  When the bank had financial
      problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job.
      In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took
      them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her
      about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should
      make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones,
      they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they
      should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.  One of my tricks for writing
      essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in
      front of a group of people and tell them something that won''t waste their time
      is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad
      computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start
      a startup. Maybe they''d be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we''d made.  So
      I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of
      seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they''d be sources

      that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because
      then they''d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking
      expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business
      plans (if I''d only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the
      talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating
      about angel investing. I''d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it
      was 7 years later and I still hadn''t done one angel investment.  Meanwhile
      I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together.
      I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we
      could collaborate on.  As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March
      11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.
      Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We''d start our
      own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we''d been talking about.
      I''d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we''d get
      Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]  Once again, ignorance worked in our
      favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there
      were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious
      choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.  There are multiple
      components to Y Combinator, and we didn''t figure them all out at once. The
      part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn''t
      go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people
      whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar
      investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were
      individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on
      the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew
      how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless
      we''d been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us
      like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult
      software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that
      stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments,
      but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.  YC was not organized
      as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money.
      That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow,
      that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any
      particular insight on our part. We didn''t know how VC firms were organized.
      It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn''t
      have known where to start. [14]  The most distinctive thing about YC is the
      batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then
      to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part
      we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance
      about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way,
      we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads
      got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer
      program where they''d start startups instead? We wouldn''t feel guilty for being
      in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders.",

      We wouldn''t feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would
      in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn''t make much
      money out of it, we''d at least get to practice being investors on them, and
      they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they
      would working at Microsoft.  We''d use the building I owned in Cambridge as
      our headquarters. We''d all have dinner there once a week \u2014 on tuesdays,
      since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays \u2014 and
      after dinner we''d bring in experts on startups to give talks.  We knew undergrads
      were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something
      we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site,
      inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would
      be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be
      the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program,
      and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who''d already
      graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting
      to feel more serious than we''d intended.  We invited about 20 of the 225 groups
      to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive
      group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went
      on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec
      and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman,
      who would later become the second president of YC. I don''t think it was entirely
      luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up
      for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at
      a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.  The deal for startups was based
      on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert
      said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder,
      which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to
      be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus
      that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air
      conditioners. [16]  Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the
      way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient
      for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but
      being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the
      biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues,
      but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you
      how they were solving them.  As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages
      of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,
      and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also
      noticed that the startups were becoming one another''s customers. We used to
      refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows this becomes less and less
      of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely
      from among their batchmates.  I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time
      job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As
      YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more
      than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to
      work on other things.  In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on
      a new version of Arc.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  The

      things.  In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version
      of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To
      test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be
      a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after
      a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn''t
      startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed
      the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one''s intellectual
      curiosity.  HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest
      source of stress for me. If all I''d had to do was select and help founders,
      life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely
      the biggest source of stress in one''s work should at least be something close
      to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running
      a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from
      an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC,
      there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do
      with everything else combined. [17]  As well as HN, I wrote all of YC''s internal
      software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually
      stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn''t have time to, and partly because
      it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had
      all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced
      to two: writing essays and working on YC.  YC was different from other kinds
      of work I''ve done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems
      came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,
      whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because
      their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective.
      If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest
      possible time, you couldn''t have picked a better way to do it.  There were
      parts of the job I didn''t like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when
      people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and
      so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn''t like. I was haunted by
      something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the
      boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second
      part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the
      upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I''d better work very hard.  One
      day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did
      something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember
      him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from
      a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me
      to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice.
      So I remember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should
      make sure Y Combinator isn''t the last cool thing you do.\"  At the time I didn''t
      understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I
      should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if
      there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong.

      So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would
      be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention.
      It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either
      YC was my life''s work or I''d have to leave eventually. And it wasn''t, so
      I would.  In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned
      out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance,
      and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and
      back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I
      used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to
      think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over
      to someone else.  I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn''t,
      so we decided we''d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor
      and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point
      YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted
      YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn''t be controlled by the
      founders. So if Sam said yes, we''d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would
      retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.  When we asked
      Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start
      a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he
      finally agreed. We decided he''d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch.
      For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could
      learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had
      returned.  She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was
      still hard when it did.  I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch
      of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still
      talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I''m interested in, but
      that only takes a few hours a week.)  What should I do next? Rtm''s advice hadn''t
      included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different,
      so I decided I''d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused
      on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty
      and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging.
      [18]  I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I''d never been able to work
      so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good
      enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran
      out of steam. Up till that point I''d always been curious to see how the painting
      I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like
      a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven''t painted
      since. So far anyway.  I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is
      a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project
      that''s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it''s getting
      in the way of another project that is.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  [18]  I

      around.  I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over
      the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren''t about startups. Then
      in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.  The distinctive thing about
      Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself.
      It wasn''t originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense.
      It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing
      machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what''s
      the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy
      invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]  McCarthy
      didn''t realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad
      student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy''s interpreter
      into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a
      programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation
      gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn''t match. It was this
      that attracted me in college, though I didn''t understand why at the time.  McCarthy''s
      1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a
      lot of things you''d want in a programming language. So these had to be added,
      and when they were, they weren''t defined using McCarthy''s original axiomatic
      approach. That wouldn''t have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his
      interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already
      getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed,
      there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated
      interpreter, you''d have had to run it, and computers then weren''t powerful
      enough.  Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy''s axiomatic
      approach till you''d defined a complete programming language. And as long as
      every change you made to McCarthy''s Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation,
      you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality.
      Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,
      why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March
      26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined
      goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.  I wrote this new
      Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but
      it''s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this
      work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something
      close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not
      fast, but fast enough to test.  I had to ban myself from writing essays during
      most of this time, or I''d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months
      writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand
      the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is
      so convoluted. When you''re working on an interpreter written in itself, it''s
      hard to keep track of what''s happening at what level, and errors can be practically
      encrypted by the time you get them.  So I said no more essays till Bel was done.
      But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must
      have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than
      I''d ever worked on anything.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  Not

      have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than
      I''d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some
      gruesome bug I''d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham
      still code?\"  Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively
      that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could
      write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in
      2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations
      while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right.
      I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good
      news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.  In the summer
      of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living
      in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed
      the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much
      that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.  In the fall
      of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy''s original Lisp, it''s a spec
      rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy''s Lisp it''s a spec expressed
      as code.  Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics
      I''d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started
      to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do?
      Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself
      to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned
      out to be. If this surprised me, who''d lived it, then I thought perhaps it
      would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly
      messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this
      is the last sentence of it.          Notes  [1] My experience skipped a step
      in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes.
      I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers
      seem all the more exciting.  [2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly
      always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps
      like polluzione). It''s the everyday words that differ. So if you string together
      a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian
      go a long way.  [3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia
      went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge,
      past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli
      to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition,
      from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were
      packed with tourists.  [4] You can of course paint people like still lives if
      you want to, and they''re willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex
      of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained
      expressions in the sitters.  [5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had
      smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore''s
      Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel)
      processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies
      like a bulldozer.  [6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren''t specifically
      mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything
      expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become
      equally expensive.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  [4]

      the apartment wasn''t rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement
      only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap,
      less than half market price.  [8] Most software you can launch as soon as it''s
      done. But when the software is an online store builder and you''re hosting the
      stores, if you don''t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious.
      So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense
      of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking
      stores.  [9] We''d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own
      page styles. They didn''t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath.
      But this wasn''t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants'' sites
      were generated, not when shoppers visited them.  [10] This was the first instance
      of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I
      read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim
      that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren''t they all Turing complete?
      People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they
      feel for me, but I''m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been
      like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must
      tell readers things they don''t already know, and some people dislike being
      told such things.  [11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s
      of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online.
      Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a)
      primary version.  [12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with
      Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the
      restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once,
      like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups
      had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they
      could be cheap and common, but the VCs'' customs still reflected the old world,
      just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the
      print era.  Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.
      less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid
      change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).  Here''s an interesting
      point, though: you can''t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid
      change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted
      that essay writing would be?  [13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At
      first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn''t want a regional name, in
      case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one
      of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.  I picked orange
      as our color partly because it''s the warmest, and partly because no VC used
      it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest
      green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo
      itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle,
      so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.  [14] YC did become a fund
      for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no
      longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough
      money to go back to being self-funded.  [15] I''ve never liked the term \"deal
      flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time
      is fixed.", "file_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt  I

      falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have
      existed.  [16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because
      there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but
      that they were all heavier than she could carry now.  [17] Another problem with
      HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a
      forum. When you run a forum, you''re assumed to see if not every conversation,
      at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people
      post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these
      two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You
      actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that
      you''re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently
      upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it''s correct. But
      that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses
      that now is their chance.  [18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working
      with Jessica anymore. We''d been working on YC almost the whole time we''d known
      each other, and we''d neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal
      lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.  [19] One way to
      get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about
      space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know
      about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty,
      that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy''s 1960 paper.  But if
      so there''s no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that
      might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too.
      So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy''s Lisp along
      which discoveredness is preserved.    Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison,

      I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked
      on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn''t write essays.
      I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still
      are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters
      with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs
      I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what
      was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14.
      The school district''s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high
      school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like
      a mini Bond villain''s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines
      \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised
      floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early
      version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them
      in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run
      it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud
      printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn''t figure out what to do with
      it. And in retrospect there''s not much I could have done with it. The only
      form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn''t have
      any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that
      didn''t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn''t
      know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I''m not surprised
      I can''t remember any programs I wrote, because they can''t have done much.
      My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not
      to terminate, when one of mine didn''t. On a machine without time-sharing, this
      was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager''s expression
      made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a
      computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your
      keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch
      cards and then stopping. [1]\n\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer
      built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed
      and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right
      into the computer.\n\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me
      years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about
      1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough.
      This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program
      to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my
      father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about
      2 pages of text, so he''d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but
      it was a lot better than a typewriter.\n\nThough I liked programming, I didn''t
      plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which
      sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the
      study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other
      fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college
      was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn''t
      much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy
      were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI
      couldn''t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was
      that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided
      to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things
      especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon
      is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and
      a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven''t tried
      rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don''t know how well it has aged,
      but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.\n\nfile_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt\n\nExcept
      for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New
      York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about
      their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because
      there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to
      write them. [12]\n\nI''ve worked on several different things, but to the extent
      there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I
      started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did,
      I''d always write essays too.\n\nI knew that online essays would be a marginal
      medium at first. Socially they''d seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on
      their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions
      published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging
      instead of discouraging.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous patterns I''ve noticed
      in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that
      weren''t prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form
      of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them.
      I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I''m writing, and
      I explain that it''s an essay I''m going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp,
      though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems
      about as hip.\n\nIt''s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se.
      But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack
      of prestige, it''s a sign both that there''s something real to be discovered
      there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big
      danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be
      the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren''t prestigious
      doesn''t guarantee you''re on the right track, it at least guarantees you''re
      not on the most common type of wrong one.\n\nOver the next several years I wrote
      lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O''Reilly reprinted a collection
      of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it.
      I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners
      for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for
      groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and
      later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.\n\nOne night in October
      2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria
      Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all
      invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other
      guests would be people they didn''t know but would probably like. One of the
      guests was someone I didn''t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman
      called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.\n\nJessica was
      in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood
      startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup
      world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories
      were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\n\nWhen
      the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started
      looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at
      a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this
      time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about
      venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead
      of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders
      instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.\n\nOne
      of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect
      of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something
      that won''t waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard
      Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided
      I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they''d be able to avoid the
      worst of the mistakes we''d made.\n\nSo I gave this talk, in the course of which
      I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,
      because then they''d be sources of advice too.\n\nfile_path: /Users/nirga/vecinity/openllmetry/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation-llamaindex/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt\n\nIn
      the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation
      had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke.
      Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like
      the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive,
      but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship
      to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department.
      The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be
      pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting
      was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which
      to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature
      style.\n\nA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business
      is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as
      yours and no one else''s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like
      a certain kind of cartoon, you know it''s by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see
      a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager,
      you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That''s not always why artists
      have a signature style, but it''s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.
      [6]\n\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in
      high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school
      in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and
      demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting
      was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school,
      but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature
      style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise
      I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in
      1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college
      friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building
      her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn''t
      much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists
      were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]\n\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny
      corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You
      can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper
      East Side, there''s a tiny corner that''s not rich, or at least wasn''t in 1993.
      It''s called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist
      \u2014 in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New
      York.\n\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was
      on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn''t want
      to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant
      C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided
      to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book
      that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the
      royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this
      book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best
      thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle
      Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I''d taken her painting
      class at Harvard. I''ve never known a teacher more beloved by her students.
      Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After
      I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to
      paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as
      I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about
      a famous fund manager. He wasn''t that much older than me, and was super rich.
      The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don''t I become rich? Then I''ll be
      able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I''d been hearing more and more
      about this new thing called the World Wide Web.\n\n  Instruction: Based on the
