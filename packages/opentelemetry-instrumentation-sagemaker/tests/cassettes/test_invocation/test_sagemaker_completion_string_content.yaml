        manner. However, I must point out that the question you''ve provided is not
        factually coherent, as llamas are not typically found in gardens. They are
        domesticated animals that are typically kept on farms or in zoos.\n\nIf you''re
        experiencing a situation where you believe there is a llama in your garden,
        I would suggest taking a closer look to verify the presence of the animal.
