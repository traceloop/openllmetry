        here''s an OpenTelemetry-themed joke for you:\n\nWhy did the developer add
        OpenTelemetry to their codebase? To trace their bugs back to the source!\n\nYou
        see, OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that helps developers
        collect, process, and export telemetry data (such as metrics, logs, and traces)
        from their applications. The joke plays on the idea that tracing and observability
        are key features of OpenTelemetry, which can help developers find and fix
        bugs more easily.\n\nI hope you found that at least mildly amusing! Let me
        know if you''d like to hear another OpenTelemetry or software engineering-themed
        joke."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":17,"output_tokens":158}}'
